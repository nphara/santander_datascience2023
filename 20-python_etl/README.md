# Useless Machine

From Wikipedia [^1]

[^1]: Wikipedia. Useless machine. Available at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useless_machine>. Visited on 2023-09-23.

> (...) is a device whose only function is to turn itself off. The best-known useless machines are those inspired by Marvin Minsky's design, in which the device's sole function is to switch itself off by operating its own "off" switch. Such machines were popularised commercially in the 1960s, sold as an amusing engineering hack, or as a joke.
> 
> More elaborate devices and some novelty toys, which have an obvious entertainment function, have been based on these simple useless machines.

These machines can demonstrate a broad range of personalities:

## Useless <s> code </s> machine

This project serves as an exercise for the "Santander Bootcamp 2023 - CiÃªncia de Dados com Python." It is associated with the "Desafio de Projeto: Explorando IA Generativa em um Pipeline de ETL com Python," which serves as an introductory activity to apply initial concepts in working with data through code.

### ETL

ETL stands for **E**xtract, **T**ransform, and **L**oad. It represents a process used to manage data: extracting it from various sources, manipulating it, and then delivering the resulting insights.

### Useless machine gears

It was designed to be as fancy as it could with the concepts of the first classes :)
- Dictionaries
- Lists
- Strings
- Tuples
- Repetition Structures
- Functions
- JSON
- Files

"While the Useless Machine code lacks conditional structures and some mathematical operators, it's worth noting that for a program designed to shut itself off, this may not be a significant drawback! :D

Similar to typical Useless Machines, this one also has its own trick. It relies on a JSON file containing 56 farewell greetings from around the world. The program selects one of these greetings and processes a message using that information. Then, the generated message is saved in another JSON and its mission is finally fulfilled.

These greetings were generously provided by ChatGPT after some interactions. Originally, the project was intended to utilize the OpenAI API, but unfortunately, the token had already expired."

## How to use it

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nphara/santander_datascience2023.git
```

Or, download as ZIP.

Access the folder `20-python_etl` and execute on terminal:

```bash
py -m useless_machine.poweron
```

## To do

Despite its simplicity, there is ample room for improvement. It has the potential for significant enhancements.

Known issues:

There is no check for the existence of data files.
Exception handling is absent.
Documentation within the code could be more comprehensive.
